**Problem Statement:**
	How might we make MoLâ€™s daily maintenance reports on assets, a more seamless experience via an audio report for building managers and shift engineers?
  



**Solution:**
	An interactive web-based tool visualises data based on various time-based data categorization. Along with graphical representation of data, the building manager gets a bird's eye view of the total notifications, number of critical alerts and onsite weather updates in the building. Besides, the building manager can also click on optional audio playback button against each alert that would read updates in the background while he/she juggles with completing other tasks. 




**Features:**

   - Summarizes reports for workers to prioritize tasks and utilize their time more efficiently.
   - Can integrate sensor data, energy meters, security data and external data like weather forecast into a time series database. 
   - Aids building managers and engineers in understanding the state of equipment and suspicious events, as well as providing warnings before a system becomes critical.
